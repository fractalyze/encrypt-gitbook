# Contribute to this Site!

We welcome anyone to find, write about, and contribute a page on a topic they are interested in! Additionally, anyone can suggest edits and update pages. Below are the rules and conventions we ask contributors to follow.

## Process for Adding a Page

### 1. Topic Selection

* We strongly recommend choosing topics based on academic papers. Product-centric studies can quickly become outdated, so please focus on theoretical backgrounds or specific code implementations within a product.\
  **Example:** Instead of a broad overview of “SP1,” focus on the theoretical background or a particular piece of code used in SP1.
* For newer fields (e.g., MPC, FHE), it is acceptable to start with overview documents or tutorials (e.g., [_Lattice Based Cryptography for Beginners_](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/938.pdf)).
* Here is the link to our [Paper Reading Research List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CAH8tEEUmh_kD7LKyF27hzMEeMZQx_Khnk6RjO1icEU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) for reference on past and future topics the maintainer team has thought up.

### 2. Writing the article

#### Language

We currently only accept articles written in English.

#### Structure of the article

We encourage authors to follow this general structure:

1. **Introduction:** Overview of the article or the problem statement.
2. **Background:** Prerequisites needed to understand the article.
3. **Protocol Explanation**: Description of features and optimization techniques.
4. **Conclusion (Final Remarks):** Benchmarks, results, or open problems.
5. **References:** A bullet point list of reference links
6. **Acknowledgements**:
   1. End the document with a statement like, “Written by \[Name] from \[Organization].”
   2. If there are external reviewers, add “Reviewed by \[Name] from \[Organization].”

### 3. Self-Review

Before requesting an internal review, ensure your article is properly formatted and free of glaring errors.

## Submitting a PR

These steps are for those creating new pages and for those adding edits or updates.

#### PR Title

Begin the title with a capitalized verb (e.g., “Add XXX” or “Update XXX”).

### 1. Internal Review

Ask for a review from every maintainer. The maintainers will review the PR to ensure it follows our guidelines and meets quality standards.

### 2. Requesting the author of the paper to review

After internal review, you _**must**_ request the original author of the academic paper (if accessible) to provide feedback.

### 3. Merge

Once your contribution has been approved by multiple maintainers, your changes will be merged! Congratulations\~

We thank you for having an interest in our work and a desire to contribute!
