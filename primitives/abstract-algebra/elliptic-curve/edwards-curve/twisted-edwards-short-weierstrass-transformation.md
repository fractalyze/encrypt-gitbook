# Twisted Edwards ↔ Short Weierstrass Transformation

## Overview

Elliptic curves can be expressed in various forms—**Weierstrass**, **Edwards**, etc.—which are often **birationally equivalent**. That means they represent the same underlying curve up to a rational change of coordinates. This equivalence is crucial in cryptography, where different forms are chosen for performance or security reasons.
